# visualize-my-boot-time
A bokeh graph that details your linux boot time. Essentially this is wanting to play around with bokeh and create some pretty graphs. I usually like seeing how much time it takes for my laptop to boot and since numbers are great and all it would be cooler to see a visualization of the boot times. Since I usually keep a collection of the boot times I can feed a bunch of data to show how the boot time is changing over time and etc. Most likely the firmware, loader, kernel and userspace times will be graphed on a pie graph to visualize in spatial terms which part of the boot process it taking the most time. 

# todo

Graph firmaware, loader, kernel, and userspace times.
utilize other important features measured on boot.
A lot of other features.
